Subject: futex: Restructure futex_requeue()
From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
Date: Tue Jul  6 16:36:56 2021 +0200

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

No point in taking two more 'requeue_pi' conditionals just to get to the
requeue. Same for the requeue_pi case just the other way round.

No functional change.
