Subject: locking/rtmutex: Provide lockdep less variants of rtmutex interfaces

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

The existing rtmutex_() functions are used by code which uses rtmutex
directly. These interfaces contain rtmutex specific lockdep operations.

The inner code can be reused for lock implementations which build on top of
rtmutexes, i.e. the lock substitutions for RT enabled kernels. But as these
are different lock types they have their own lockdep operations. Calling
the existing rtmutex interfaces for those would cause double lockdep checks
and longer lock chains for no value.

Provide rt_mutex_lock_state(), __rt_mutex_trylock() and __rt_mutex_unlock()
which are not doing any lockdep operations on the rtmutex itself. The
caller has to do them on the lock type which embeds the rtmutex.
