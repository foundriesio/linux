Subject: [PATCH 10/25] hrtimer: Make handling of hrtimer reprogramming and
 enqueuing not conditional

The hrtimer_reprogramming, remote timer enqueuing and handling of the
hrtimer_cpu_base struct member expires_next depend on the active high
resolution timers. This makes the code harder to understand.

To simplify the code, the hrtimer reprogramming is now executed
independently except for the real reprogramming part. The expires_next
stores now the first enqueued timer. Due to the adaption of the
check_target function, remote enqueuing is now only possible when the
expiry time is after the currently first expiry time independent of the
active high resolution timers.
