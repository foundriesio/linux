Subject: futex: Validate waiter correctly in futex_proxy_trylock_atomic()

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

The loop in futex_requeue() has a sanity check for the waiter which is
missing in futex_proxy_trylock_atomic(). In theory the key2 check is
sufficient, but futexes are cursed so add it for completness and paranoia
sake.
