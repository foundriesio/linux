PREEMPT_RT replaces 'struct mutex' with a rtmutex based variant so all
mutex operations are included into the priority inheritance scheme.

But a complete replacement of the mutex implementation would require to
reimplement ww_mutex on top of the rtmutex based variant. That has been
tried, but the outcome is dubious if not outright wrong in some cases:

   1) ww_mutex by it's semantics can never provide any realtime properties

   2) The waiter ordering of ww_mutex depends on the associated context
      stamp, which is not possible with priority based ordering on a
      rtmutex based implementation

So a rtmutex based ww_mutex would be semanticaly different and
incomplete. Aside of that the ww_mutex specific helpers cannot be shared
between the regular mutex and the RT variant, so they are likely to diverge
further and grow different properties and bugs.

The alternative solution is to make it possible to compile the ww_mutex
specific part of the regular mutex implementation as is on RT and have a
rtmutex based 'struct mutex' variant.

As the regular mutex and ww_mutex implementation are tightly coupled
(ww_mutex has a 'struct mutex' inside) and share a lot of code (ww_mutex is
mostly an extension) a simple replacement of 'struct mutex' does not work.

To solve this attach a typedef to 'struct mutex': _mutex_t

This new type is then used to replace 'struct mutex' in 'struct ww_mutex',
in a few helper functions and in the actual regular mutex code. None of the
actual usage sites of mutexes are affected.

That allows in the final step to have a RT specific 'struct mutex' and the
regular _mutex_t type.
