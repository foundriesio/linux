Subject: sched: Split out the wakeup state check

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

RT kernels have a slightly more complicated handling of wakeups due to
'sleeping' spin/rwlocks. If a task is blocked on such a lock then the
original state of the task is preserved over the blocking and any regular
(non lock related) wakeup has to be targeted at the saved state to ensure
that these wakeups are not lost. Once the task acquired the lock it
restores the task state from the saved state.

To avoid cluttering try_to_wake_up() with that logic, split the wake up
state check out into an inline helper and use it at both places where
task::state is checked against the state argument of try_to_wake_up().

No functional change.
