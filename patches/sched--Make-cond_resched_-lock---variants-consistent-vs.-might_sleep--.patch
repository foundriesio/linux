Subject: sched: Make cond_resched_*lock() variants consistent vs. might_sleep()

Commit 3427445afd26 ("sched: Exclude cond_resched() from nested sleep
test") removed the task state check of __might_sleep() for
cond_resched_lock() because cond_resched_lock() is not a voluntary
scheduling point which blocks. It's a preemption point which requires the
lock holder to release the spin lock.

The same rationale applies to cond_resched_rwlock_read/write(), but those
were not touched.

Make it consistent and use the non-state checking __might_resched() there
as well.
