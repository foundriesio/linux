Subject: [PATCH 09/25] hrtimer: Reduce conditional code (hrtimer_reprogram())

The hrtimer_reprogram() is currently required only when
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS is set. Additional bitfields of hrtimer_cpu_base
struct are high resolution timer specific as well.

To simplify the hrtimer code, the behaviour of CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS and
!CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS should be similar. As preparation for this, the
function hrtimer_reprogram() and required hrtimer_cpu_base struct members
are moved outside the conditional area.
