	  Telehips bootstage helper driver creates and manages the `bootstage`
	  procfs which provides the interface for printing out the timestamps
	  for each bootstage.

	  To use this option, Trusted Firmware must provide SiP service for
	  passing boot time information per each bootstage.

	  suspend, resume) accordingly including some software workarounds

	  enabling this, (1) CORE0p8 power off timing is delayed for 16.4
	  msec and (2) SYS_EN IRQ is unmasked to get wake-up signal, as the
	  workaround.

	  While only some versions of DA9062 PMICs need this workaround, the
	  others will not be affected by this option. So disable this for
	  such case.

	  PMIC on TCC805x SoC based platformm, into TCC805x PM driver. By
	  enabling this, (1) voltage slew rate is adjusted correctly and (2)
	  GPIO1/2 pull-up/pull-down is enabled, as the workaround.

	  While only some versions of DA9131 PMICs need this workaround, the
	  others will not be affected by this option. So disable this for
	  such case.

	  If unsure, say Y.
