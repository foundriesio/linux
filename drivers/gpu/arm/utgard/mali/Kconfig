config MALI_UTGARD
	tristate "Mali-300/400/450 support"
	default n	
	depends on FB && (ARM || ARM64)
	select DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	---help---
	  This enables support for the ARM Mali-300, Mali-400, and Mali-450
	  GPUs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mali.

config MALI450
	bool "Enable Mali-450 support"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables support for Mali-450 specific features.

config MALI470
	bool "Enable Mali-470 support"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD
	---help---
	  This enables support for Mali-470 specific features.

config MALI400_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debug in Mali driver"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD
	default n
	---help---
	  This enabled extra debug checks and messages in the Mali driver.

config MALI400_PROFILING
	bool "Enable Mali profiling"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD
	select TRACEPOINTS
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables gator profiling of Mali GPU events.

config MALI400_INTERNAL_PROFILING
	bool "Enable internal Mali profiling API"
	depends on MALI400_PROFILING
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables the internal legacy Mali profiling API.

config GPU_BUS_SCALING
	bool "Use GPU bus scaling"
	default n
	depends on MALI_UTGARD
	---help---
	   Use GPU bus scaling for Mali GPU

config MALI_DVFS
	bool "Enable Mali dynamically frequency change"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD && !GPU_BUS_SCALING
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables support for dynamic change frequency of Mali with the goal of lowering power consumption.

config MALI_DMA_BUF_FENCE
	bool "Enable dma_buf_fence"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD && DRM
	default y
	---help---
	  A dma buffer fence can be attached to a shared dma buffer that is
	  being filled or consumed by a different hardware component.
	  Alternatively, the dma buffer can be passed to the GPU without
  	  waiting for the display device, the GPU is only required to attach a
	  callback to wait for the notification.
	  
config MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_ATTACH
	bool "Map dma-buf attachments on attach"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD && DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	default y
	---help---
	  This makes the Mali driver map dma-buf attachments after doing
	  attach. If this is not set the dma-buf attachments will be mapped for
	  every time the GPU need to access the buffer.

	  Mapping for each access can cause lower performance.

config MALI_SHARED_INTERRUPTS
	bool "Support for shared interrupts"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD
	default n
	---help---
	  Adds functionality required to properly support shared interrupts.  Without this support,
	  the device driver will fail during insmod if it detects shared interrupts.  This also
	  works when the GPU is not using shared interrupts, but might have a slight performance
	  impact.

config MALI_PMU_PARALLEL_POWER_UP
	bool "Power up Mali PMU domains in parallel"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD
	default n
	---help---
	  This makes the Mali driver power up all PMU power domains in parallel, instead of
	  powering up domains one by one, with a slight delay in between. Powering on all power
	  domains at the same time may cause peak currents higher than what some systems can handle.
	  These systems must not enable this option.

config MALI_DT
	bool "Using device tree to initialize module"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD && OF
	default y
	---help---
	  This enable the Mali driver to choose the device tree path to get platform resoures
	  and disable the old config method. Mali driver could run on the platform which the
	  device tree is enabled in kernel and corresponding hardware description is implemented
	  properly in device DTS file.

config MALI_DEVFREQ
	bool "Using devfreq to tuning frequency"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD && PM_DEVFREQ
	default n
	---help---
	Support devfreq for Mali.

	Using the devfreq framework and, by default, the simpleondemand
	governor, the frequency of Mali will be dynamically selected from the
	available OPPs.

config MALI_QUIET
	bool "Make Mali driver very quiet"
	depends on MALI_UTGARD && !MALI400_DEBUG
	default n
	---help---
	  This forces the Mali driver to never print any messages.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MALI_OS_MEMORY
	bool "Use OS memory"
	default y
	depends on MALI_UTGARD
	---help---
	   Use OS memory for Mali GPU

config MALI_MEMORY_SIZE
	int "Mali memory size"
	default 512 if TCC_MEM_1024MB
	default 300 if TCC_MEM_512MB
	depends on MALI_OS_MEMORY && !OF
	---help---
	    Memory size for Mali GPU
