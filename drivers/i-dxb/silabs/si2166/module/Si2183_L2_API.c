/* Change log:
 As from V0.3.5.1:
      <correction>[flags] Re-adding 'endif DEMOD_DVB-T2 ' following Si2183_TerAutoDetectOff (mistakenly removed as from v0.3.1.0)
        No big impact, but this created an inconsistent naming in 'define/endif' sequence, and
                entire removal of SILABS_API_TEST_PIPE was not possible anymore.

 As from V0.3.5.0:
    <improvement>[traces] Adding explicit ISDB-T code in Si2183_L2_Tune.
        Requires SiLabs_TER_Tuner V0.6.6 (with definition of L1_RF_TER_TUNER_MODULATION_ISDBT)
        NB: As stated in SiLabs_TER_Tuner V0.6.6 change log, this is more a cosmetic change, to support ISDB-T in a nicer way.

 As from V0.3.4.0:
    <Wrapper> Wrapper V2.8.0
    <improvement>[SCAN/Traces] In Si2183_L2_SW_Init: activating trylock traces during blindscan (this has no effect unless ALLOW_Si2183_BLINDSCAN_DEBUG is active)
    <improvement>[SCAN/Abort] In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Abort: Calling Si2183_L1_SCAN_CTRL to end a potential scan
    <improvement>[SILENT] In Si2183_L2_SILENT: calling Si2183_Configure to make sure GPIOs are set back to active states

 As from V0.3.3.1:
    <firmware> With FW 5_5b16 on x55 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_9b6 on  x59 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_0b19 on x50 parts
    <firmware> With FW 4_0b31 on x40 parts
    <correction> registers address matching -x50,x55 and x60 parts
    <improvement> more registers logged by Si2183_L2_Health_Check(). Function called in case blindscan timeout
    <improvement> demodulator part number and firmware version logged when calling Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Init()

 As from V0.3.3.0:
    <improvement>[DVB-T/Checks] Only adding DVB-T2 check code if CHECK_DVB_T2_SIGNALLING is declared
    <firmware> With FW 6_4b7  on x63 parts with    CHANNEL_BONDING
    <firmware> With FW 6_3b6  on x63 parts without CHANNEL_BONDING
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b13 on x60 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_0b18 on x50 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_5b15 on x55 parts
    <firmware> With FW 4_0b30 on x40 parts
    <new_feature>[DVB-S2/MIS] In Si2183_L2_Seek_next: calling DVBS2_STATUS and setting num_plp = num_is when locked in DVB-S2
    <improvement>[ATV]
      In Si2183_Media: returning Si2183_TERRESTRIAL for Si2183_DD_MODE_PROP_MODULATION_ANALOG
                       returning 0 for unknown standards
      In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: setting front_end->demod->media in all cases (not only when dtv_demod_needed == 1)
      In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: always calling TER_TUNER_ATV_LO_INJECTION if new_standard is Si2183_DD_MODE_PROP_MODULATION_ANALOG
    <compatibility>[TRACES/GET_REG] always compiling Si2183_L2_GET_REG
    <improvement>[TER/handshake] Moving ddRestartTime in Si2183_L2_Context, for easier tracking.
    <improvement>[SAT/DISEQC] In Si2183_L2_prepare_diseqc_sequence and Si2183_L2_send_diseqc_sequence: initial value of bus_state set based on a call to Si2183_L1_DD_DISEQC_STATUS.
      This saves 12 ms when the bus is ready.

*/
/* Older changes:

 As from V0.3.2.0:
    <Wrapper> Wrapper V2.7.9
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b11 on x60 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_5b14 on x55 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_0b17 on x50 parts
    <correction>[DVB-T2/debug] In Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier: only checking DVB-T2 misc infos if _DVB_T2_SIGNALLING_H_ is declared (only possible with SiLabs_DVB_T2_Signalling.c/SiLabs_DVB_T2_Signalling.h files added to the project).
    <correction>[SAT/UnicableII] In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Init: using front_end->unicable_mode to set the BW value in Unicable
    <improvement>[Si2183_B63_COMPATIBLE] Adding missing comment around CHANNEL_BONDING tag, to avoid compilation error.
    <improvement>[I2C/Pass-Through] In Si2183_Configure: Setting scl_mast_slr register to avoid reduction of Thd_dat from HOST to MAST
    <compatibility>[compiler/warnings] In Si2183_LoadFirmwareSPI_Split: i defined as unsigned int.
    <compatibility>[compiler/warnings] In Si2183_DVB_C_max_lock_ms: afc_khz defined as signed int to allow comparison with symbol_rate_baud.
    <compatibility>[compiler/warnings] In Si2183_L2_Set_Index_and_Tag: tag defined as const char*.
    <compatibility>[compiler/warnings] In Si2183_L2_Test: target, cmd and sub_cmd declared as const char*.
    <compatibility>[TestPipe/chip_detect] In Si2183_L2_Test: Now returning '83A' for Si2167D parts (only used for macro selection).

 As from V0.3.1.0:
    <improvement>[init/AGC] Forcing the use of AGC2 internal loop for TER and AGC1 internal loop for SAT
      In Si2183_L2_TER_AGC: Forcing TER AGC settings in agc2 internal loop
      In Si2183_L2_SAT_AGC: Forcing SAT AGC settings in agc1 internal loop
    <improvement>[debug/registers] Updating register codes to match Si2183 to allow using Si2183_L2_Health_Check
    <improvement>[DVB-T/No_T2] In Si2183_prepare_DD_MODE: calling Si2183_TerAutoDetect to force front_end->auto_detect_TER if the part doesn't support T2.
      This is only useful when building code with DEMOD_DVB_T2 to be compatible with parts supporting T2 and parts not supporting T2.
    <improvement>[DVB-C/blindscan] Introducing Si2183_DVBC_MAX_SCAN_TIME to handle difficult DVVB-C blindscan cases where the analyzis time is higher than the DVB-C lock time
    <new_feature>[DVB-T2/MPLP] In Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier: tracing the PLP values in case the signal is DVB-T2/MPLP (only if SiTRACES are defined).
      This can be useful to check the MPLP implementation in the application layer.
    <correction>[Lock_abort/Handshake] Corrected front_end->lockAbort management in Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier and Si2183_L2_Channel_Lock_Abort (disabled is front_end->lockAbort is set to 0).
      Now only setting front_end->lockAbort to 0 before leaving when front_end->lockAbort = 1.
      This only had an impact on applications calling SiLabs_API_Channel_Seek_Abort while in handshake mode with front_end->handshakePeriod_ms lower
        than 500 ms (the amount of time needed to detect a 'never_lock' situation).
    <new_feature>[test/property] In Si2183_L2_Test: Adding a 'setProperty' option to allow setting any property.

 As from V0.3.0.0:
    <compatibility>[compiler/warnings] In Si2183_plot: modified traces for long int
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b7  on x60 parts when CHANNEL_BONDING is NOT required

 As from V0.2.9.0:
    <Wrapper> Wrapper V2.7.4
    <firmware> With FW 6_3b3  on '80' x60 parts
    <firmware> With FW 6_4b3  on x63 parts when CHANNEL_BONDING is required
    <firmware> With FW 6_3b3  on x63 parts when CHANNEL_BONDING is NOT required
    <firmware> With FW 6_2b2  on x60 parts when CHANNEL_BONDING is required
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b6  on x60 parts when CHANNEL_BONDING is NOT required
    <new_feature>[TS/Duals/Channel_Bonding] For Duals, CHANNEL_BONDING is now possible.
    <correction>[Si2180_B60_COMPATIBLE/ISDB-T/FW] In Si2183_PowerUpWithPatch: Correcting part_info.chiprev test for x80 parts (these are 'B' parts)
    <improvement>[standard_switch]
      Adding Si2183_prepare_DD_MODE to set dd_mode.auto_detect and dd_mode.modulation based on the requested standard
      In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: Using Si2183_prepare_DD_MODE to set dd_mode.auto_detect and dd_mode.modulation
      NB: This is because some customers use to call Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard without doing a lock. In this situation the demod could
            be inadvertently set in non-auto mode. With the changes the auto lock mode is preserved.
      NB: Applications using a normal switch/lock sequence don't require these changes (which don't change their behavior when applied).
    <improvement>[compatibility] In Si2183_plot: minor cosmetic changes to avoid compiler warnings with some compilers.

 As from V0.2.8.0:
    <Wrapper> Wrapper V2.7.1
    <new_Part>[x63] In Si2183_PowerUpWithPatch: Adding compatibility with x63 parts.
    <firmware> With FW 6_3b1  on x63 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_5b13 on x55 parts
    <correction>[MCNS/lock/bw]
      In Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier: setting MCNS bw as ter_bandwidth_hz/1000000 (previously hardcoded as 8)
    <correction>[DVB-T2/FEF]
      In Si2183_Configure: Correcting the FEF pin settings when NOT in DVB-T2 (when MPs are in 'default' mode).
        (This didn't generate issues because generally the FEF pin is also disabled when not in DVB-T).
    <correction>[SAT/DiSEqC_read]
      In Si2183_L2_read_diseqc_reply: Correcting the test to read DiSEqC bytes.
    <improvement>[ISDB-T/test]
      In Si2183_Configure: removing ISDB-T property settings (used for testing). (No effect on other standards).
    <improvement>[Traces/setup]
      In Si2183_Configure: Tracing the function name when tracing the media.
    <improvement>[traces/blindscan]
      In Si2183_L2_SW_Init: setting front_end->misc_infos = 0x00000000;
        This value can be modified when scan debugging is required.
    <improvement>[DVB-T2/TestPipe]
      In testcode used with SiLabs_DVB_T2_Signalling.h:
        Adding Si2164 and Si2167B register definitions to stay compatible with Si2183_READ/Si2183_WERITE macros (now compatible with legacy parts)
        Using SiTRACE_X instead of SiTRACE whenever required to avoid compilation errors due to tag and level tracing.

 As from V0.2.7.0:
    <firmware> Correction in tags for x5B parts FW loading
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b5  on X60 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_0b16 on X50 parts
    <improvement>[Blindscan/traces/spectrum]
      In Si2183_plot: adapted for better compatibility with various compilers. Not using floats anymore.
      In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: adding traces to help possible blindscan issues on difficult channels.
    <compatibility>[x55/DVB-S2/MIS]
      In Si2183_PowerUpWithPatch: setting MIS_capability field for x55 parts
    <new_feature>[Debug/Spectrum/FFT]
      Adding FFT tracing capability. This can be useful to avoid using a spectrum analyzer to get a view of the channel spectrum.
      NB: This is only active if Si2183_FFT_CAPABILITY is defined.
    <improvement>[Blindscan/SAT/Turksat] Due to low SR closely spaced channels present on Turksat it may happen that some chunks take more than 60s.
      To cope with this, the SAT blindscan timeout (only used in case the FW crhashes, which is not supposed to happen) is increased
        #define Si2183_SAT_MAX_SEARCH_TIME 120000
      NB: This has no impact on the scan duration. It allows the Turksat channels to be detected as expected.
    <improvement>[Debug/Spectrum/Traces]
      Adding front_end->misc_infos in Si2183_L2_Context to pass various parameters from L3.
        This will contain:
          misc_infos[ 7: 0] : LNB control voltage value
          misc_infos[11: 8] : LNB control tone value
          misc_infos[15:12] : Trigger FFT when Si2183_L2_Tune is called
          misc_infos[19:16] : Trace blindscan spectrum
          misc_infos[23:20] : Trace blindscan trylocks
          misc_infos[24]    : Trace DVB-T2 signalling
      In Si2183_L2_Tune:
        If ( front_end->misc_infos & 0x00001000 ) Trigger FFT tracing.
      In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
        Adding current frequency and front_end->misc_infos to blindscan traces.
          This will allow identifying the SAT quadrant currently scanned.
        If ( front_end->misc_infos & 0x00010000 ) Trigger Spectrum tracing.
        If ( front_end->misc_infos & 0x00100000 ) Trigger Trylock tracing.
      Using front_end->cumulativeScanTime to store time spent in Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next (as already done for 'non-blind' scan).

 As from V0.2.6.0:
    <Wrapper> Wrapper V2.7.1
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b3  on X60 parts, to avoid potential DVB-S blindscan misses if checking fec_lock (regression in FW as from 6_0b).
    <firmware> With FW 5_5b11 on X55 parts, to avoid potential DVB-S blindscan misses if checking fec_lock (regression in FW as from 5_5b6).
    <correction>[DVB-S/blindscan/fec_lock] Correction done in FW.
      Background info on the regression: To avoid rare false DVB-S lock on LTE signals, and additional level of lock checking has been implemented.
        The check consists in making sure that at least one valid TS packet has been received (when locked in DVB-S).
        If this is not the case, fec_lock is reported as '0' while demod_lock is '1'.
        This is OK for 'lock_to_carrier' but not for DVB-S blindscan.
        The new FWs correct this, coming back to the previous behavior during SAT blindscan.
      NB: This has an effect on the application only under the following conditions:
        SAT blindscan
        Locked on DVB-S following a call to 'SeekNext' --> 'SeekNext' returns 1.
        The application is calling the status function and then checking status->fec_lock before accepting the channel.
      No issue for applications relying on the return value of 'SeekNext'.
      No issue for applications performing a 'lock_to_carrier' once a carrier has been detected using 'SeekNext'.

 As from V0.2.5.0:
    <improvement>[DVB-C/lock_timeout] In Si2183_DVB_C_max_lock_ms: Changes to avoid value overflow when afc_freq above 192 kHz, while still using no floats.
    <Wrapper> Wrapper V2.7.0
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b2 in SPI mode on X60 parts

 As from V0.2.3.0:
    <wrapper> Wrapper V2.6.6
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b2 on X60 parts.
    <new_feature>[init/force_full_init] In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: using new defines for force_full_init (instead of using only 0 or 1).
      This is useful to allow setting up the entire frontend in any mode using a single call to Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard.
        #define Si2183_SKIP_DEMOD_INIT      0x02 (useful if demod already initialized using broadcast_i2c)
        #define Si2183_FORCE_TER_TUNER_INIT 0x04 (useful to initialize the TER tuner while the final standard is SLEEP or a SAT standard)
        #define Si2183_FORCE_SAT_TUNER_INIT 0x08 (useful to initialize the SAT tuner while the final standard is SLEEP or a TER standard)
        #define Si2183_FORCE_DEMOD_INIT     0x10 (useful to initialize the demodulator while the final standard is SLEEP)
        #define Si2183_USE_TER_CLOCK        0x20 (useful with Si2183_FORCE_DEMOD_INIT if using the TER clock)
        #define Si2183_USE_SAT_CLOCK        0x40 (useful with Si2183_FORCE_DEMOD_INIT if using the SAT clock)
      Most changes are only done if force_full_init > 1 (i.e. the new flags are used).
      Other changes consist in only sending tuner commands when tuners are active, to cope with the new features.

      Use cases:
        Normal call with no init:
          SiLabs_API_switch_to_standard  (fe[0], standard, 0 );

        Normal call with init forced (parts actually initialized depend on standard):
          SiLabs_API_switch_to_standard  (fe[0], standard, 1 );

        New: Only going through the demodulator init then putting it in SLEEP mode, assuming that the TER clock is already on:
          SiLabs_API_switch_to_standard  (fe[0], SILABS_SLEEP, Si2183_FORCE_DEMOD_INIT | Si2183_USE_TER_CLOCK );

        New: Dual front_end init using Broadcast_i2c, then putting both frontends in SLEEP after initializing all parts:
          SiLabs_API_Demods_Broadcast_I2C(fes, 2 );
          SiLabs_API_switch_to_standard  (fe[0], SILABS_SLEEP, Si2183_SKIP_DEMOD_INIT | Si2183_FORCE_SAT_TUNER_INIT | Si2183_FORCE_TER_TUNER_INIT );
          SiLabs_API_switch_to_standard  (fe[1], SILABS_SLEEP, Si2183_SKIP_DEMOD_INIT | Si2183_FORCE_SAT_TUNER_INIT | Si2183_FORCE_TER_TUNER_INIT );

    <improvement>[traces]
      In Si2183_standardName: now also returning a string for ANALOG.
      In Si2183_Media: tracing the value of standard when it's unknown.
      In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: tracing the state of all parts when complete.

 As from V0.2.2.0:
    <wrapper> Wrapper V2.6.6
    <correction>[dual/triple/quad/broadcast_I2c] In Si2183_PowerUpUsingBroadcastI2C: Only loading FW in broadcast_I2C mode. StartFirmware now done in normal mode.
    <improvements>[traces/dual/triple/quad/broadcast_I2c] In Si2183_PowerUpWithPatch: tracing which parts of the function are skipped when using broadcast_I2C to load FW in several parts at once.
    <improvement>[spectrum/plot] In Si2183_plot: Correcting frequency values displayed in Unicable
    <improvement>[traces/blindscan] In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: Tracing symbol rate value when locked
    <improvement>[traces/duals/die] In Si2183_Configure: also tracing the die value (used to identify duals). Mainly useful when using duals.
    <compatibility>[Testpipe/IQ] Making Si2183_L2_Get_Constellation_IQ compatible with all API-controlled parts.

 As from V0.2.0.0:
    <improvement>[Dual/robustness] In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: making sure the i2c passthrough is disabled before returning.
      This helps when there are execution errors accessing the TER or SAT tuner (this should not happen, but may occur during development).
      This is to prevent the i2c bus from being stalled in a dual/triple/quad) situation where both pass through should never be enabled
        simultaneously. NB: Using dedicated INDIRECT_I2C _CONNECTION settings the application can avoid this situation (the recommendation is to use a single pass through).

 As from V0.1.9.0:
    <testpipe>[DVB-C2/EWS] In Si2183_L2_Test: adding capability to retrieve the DVB-C2 EWS bit information.
    <improvement>[Traces] In Si2183_PowerUpUsingBroadcastI2C: using SiTRACE_X since the function uses several demods.

 As from V0.1.8.0:
    <wrapper> Wrapper V2.6.2
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b1 on X60 parts, with proper GET_REV return values.
    <improvement>[FW/updating]
        Setting a generic FW name for each part's FW while '#including' the FW file.
      In Si2183_PowerUpWithPatch:
        Hardcoding PMAJOR/PMINOR/PBUILD values used to check against PART_INFO values before loading FW. This removes the need to have these values set in FW files.
        Computing nb of lines to load based on the generic FW name.
        All these changes remove the need to change Si2183_PowerUpWithPatch when updating the FW.
    <improvement>[DVB-C/timeout] In Si2183_DVB_C_max_lock_ms: changing swt formula to better match legacy devices. Changing default swt_coef to 14 (previously 13) and offset back to 100.

 As from V0.1.7.0:
    <wrapper> Wrapper V2.6.2
    <firmware> With FW 6_0b1 on X60 parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_Bb5 on X5A parts
    <firmware> With FW 5_5b7 on X55 parts
    <firmware> With FW 2_2b9 on X22 parts

    <improvement>[power_consumption/Tuner_standby] In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: on first init, setting the SAT tuner and TER tuner to STANDBY when they are only used as clock sources, to save power.
      This is done only if SAT_TUNER_STANDBY_WITH_CLOCK and TER_TUNER_STANDBY_WITH_CLOCK are defined, because all tuners may not have the capability to continue driving a clock while in standby.
    <improvement>[DVB-C/timeout] In Si2183_DVB_C_max_lock_ms: changing swt formula to avoid overflows. Changing default swt_coef to 13 (previously 11).
    <improvement>[DVB_T2/MPLP/Seek] In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: calling Si2183_L1_DVBT2_PLP_SELECT to set the PLP selection mode to 'auto'.
      The previous version required this to be done at MW level during a DVB-T2 scan with multiple PLPs.
    <compatibility>[Xtal/Cap/SUPERSET]
      In Si2183_L2_SW_Init: setting default value of start_clk.tune_cap
        It can be overwritten later on by calling SiLabs_API_XTAL_Capacitance if different values need to be used
          for different platforms (i.e. when using Xtals with different internal capacitance).
      In Si2183_WAKEUP: only forcing start_clk.tune_cap when not driving a xtal. Otherwise, use the value set in Si2183_L2_SW_Init and possibly overwritten by a call to SiLabs_API_XTAL_Capacitance.

 As from V0.1.6.0:
    <compatibility>[SILABS_SUPERSET/TER/SAT] Replacing tags in several functions  to allow compiling for TER-only or SAT-only
    Si2183_Configure
    Si2183_L2_SW_Init
    Si2183_L2_Set_Index_and_Tag
    Si2183_L2_HW_Connect
    <compatibility>[SILABS_SUPERSET/NO_TER] Removing AGC2 trace in Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next because it uses the TER agc
    <improvement>[DVB-T/T2/ISDB-T/never lock] In Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier: checking rsqstat_bit5 instead of rsqint_bit5
      rsqstat_nit5 is the 'never lock' flag for DVB-T/T2 and ISDB-T.
      This flag is raised:
      - In DVB-T when correlation with TPS cannot be achieved
      - In DVB-T2 when P1 symbol is not detected
      - In auto_T_T2 when neither P1 nor TPS are detected.
      - In ISDB-T when TMCC correlation cannot be achieved.
      rsqint_bit5 signals the transition from 0 to 1 of rsqstat_bit5, and is cleared using 'INTACK_CLEAR'.
      While checking rsqint_bit5 with 'INTACK_CLEAR' the transition can be cleared inadvertently if it occurs during the execution of DD_STATUS (rate around 4%).
      In this case, Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier would return 0 (i.e 'not locked') after the timeout instead of on rsqatat_bit5 (i.e. 'never lock') rising.
      No big impact on the application, but may help reduce scan time for customers using 'lock_to_carrier' instead of 'Seek_Init/Seek_Next' for T/T2/ISDB-T installation.

    <firmware> With FW 5_Bb3 on X5A parts
    <improvement>[DVB-C2/Seek]
      In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
        DD_RESTART following DVBC2_CTRL/ACTION_START, to completely restart the lock for each new freq.
        Waiting 2 ms to have dvbc2_ctrl.tuned_rf_freq processed by the part before DD_RESTART.
    <improvement>[SILABS_SUPERSET/Standards]
      Replacing 'DEMOD_xyz' by either 'TERRESTRIAL_FRONT_END' or 'SATELLITE_FRONT_END' to better allow
        standard-by-standard compilation when using SILABS_SUPERSET.
      In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: Regrouping TER and SAT flags to limit the number of '#ifdef' lines.
        Some 'case' blocks can also be re-written for better readibility, considering that all 'modulation' values are defined even when
        not compiling with all standards, and this doesn't impact the code size a lot.

       In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next: Correcting calls to Si2183_L1_DVBC2_STATUS: using Si2183_DVBC2_STATUS_CMD_INTACK_CLEAR.
    <compatibility>[Tizen/int&char] explicitly declaring all 'int as 'signed int' and all 'char' as 'signed char'.
      This is because Tizen interprets 'int' as 'unsigned int' and 'char' as 'unsigned char'.
      All other OSs   interpret 'int' as 'signed   int' and 'char as 'signed char', so this change doesn't affect other compilers.
      To compare versions above V0.1.3.0 with older versions:
        Do not compare whitespace characters
        Either filter 'signed' or replace 'signed   int' with 'signed' and 'signed   char' with 'char' in the newer code first.

    <improvement>[DVB-C2/T_T2/TER_Tuner]
      In Si2183_L2_Tune: Selecting internal LIF in TER tuner when in 1.7 MHz or C2. Using ZIF for other cases (T or T2 above 1.7 MHz).
        With the previous code, LIF was selected if using AUTO_DETECT/AUTO_T_T2 after tuning in DVB-C2 (which is using LIF).

      In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:
        Improved DVB-C2 scan, with auto BW detection (6 or 8 MHz).
        DVB-C2 Seek now using 'NOT_DVBC2' API flag.
    <new_feature>[DVB-S2/Multiple_Input_Stream]
      In Si2183_PowerUpWithPatch:
        Setting MIS_capability flag to 1 for parts supporting this feature.
      In Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier:
        Using plp_id input parameter as isi_id when in DVB-S2. (if supporting MIS).
        Setting stream selection to 'auto' if isi_id(i.e. plp_id parameter) is '-1' (same behavior as for plp_id it T2 or C2).
      In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Init:
        Forcing DVB-S2 stream selection to 'auto' (if supporting MIS).
    <new_feature>[Broadcast_i2c/demods]
      Adding Si2183_PowerUpUsingBroadcastI2C to load FW in several demodulators using the broadcast i2c mode. (only used for 'multiple' designs).
      In Si2183_PowerUpWithPatch: using api->load_control to run onliy selected parts of the function, depending on the progress
        of the Si2183_PowerUpUsingBroadcastI2C function.
      In Si2183_L2_SW_Init:
        setting TER_tuner_config_done to 0. This is a new flag used to separate TER tuner init and TER tuner configuration.
      The TER tuner init is identical, but the configuration differs depending on the front_end, so these need to be treated separately.
      In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard:
        checking TER_tuner_config_done flag to do the TER tuner configuration only when needed (once and after broadcast i2c).
      SiLabs_TER_Tuner_DTV_OUT_TYPE and SiLabs_TER_Tuner_DTV_AGC_SOURCE moved out of the TER tuner init code (this can now be bypassed if using broadcast i2c).
    <improvement>[comments]
      In Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier:
        Adapting comment to indicate the use of the plp_id for DVB-C2 PLP and DVB-S2 ISI id.

    <improvement>[SEEK/NO_DVBT2] In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next:

      This is done using the front_end->auto_detect_TER flag, which should not be '1' for parts not supporting T2.
    <improvement>[SEEK/DSS] In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Next and Si2183_L2_lock_to_carrier
      Added compatibility with DSS, with no impact on AUTO_DVB_S_S2 mode:
       AUTO_DVB_S_S2_DSS is only used if the standard is explicitly DSS.
       This is because otherwise the auto lock is a bit slower, while most platforms don't need to support DSS.

    <new_feature>[TER_Tuner/Config] In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard:
     Calling SiLabs_TER_Tuner_DTV_OUT_TYPE and SiLabs_TER_Tuner_DTV_AGC_SOURCE instead of TER_TUNER_AGC_EXTERNAL
     NB: To take benefit of this modification, update your TER Tuner wrapper to V0.4.1 or above, to get access to
      the SiLabs_TER_Tuner_DTV_OUT_TYPE and SiLabs_TER_Tuner_DTV_AGC_SOURCE functions.
     NB: No change required for existing applications, since this is mostly useful to use LIF_IF1 with SiLabs TER tuners,
      when compared with the previous versions which by default use LIF_IF2.
    <improvement>[SAT blindscan] In Si2183_plot: Adding additional spectrum debug information. SAT blindscan now ready to be

      UNICABLE_COMPATIBLE      NOT defined
      INDIRECT_I2C_CONNECTION  defined
    <correction> [SILENT/SLEEP/ANALOG] In Si2183_L2_switch_to_standard: Adding dtv_demod_sleeping flag to
        more easily handle the 'sleep' mode, which can occur upon a clock source change in DTV, or when
        going to 'ANALOG' or 'ATV'. The WAKEUP sequence is required in the first case, not in the second case.
    <improvement> [Unicable/Multi-Treading/Multiple frontends] In Si2183_L2_TER_FEF_SETUP: removing I2C pass-through enable/disable.
    This is only called from switch_to_standard, and the i2c pass-through is already enabled when calling this function.
    The change removes nested i2c pass-through enable/disable calls.
    These had generally no consequences, except for duals when several tuners use the same i2c address.
    <improvement> [BLINDSCAN/DEBUG/SPECTRUM] In Si2183_L2_Channel_Seek_Init:

  Si2183_lock_to_carrier function
  Use:      relocking function
            Used to relock on a channel for the current standard
            options:
              if freq = 0, do not tune. This is useful to test the lock time without the tuner delays.
              if freq < 0, do not tune and don't change settings. Just do a DD_RESTART. This is useful to test the relock time upom a reset.
  Parameter: standard the standard to lock to
  Parameter: freq                the frequency to lock to    (in Hz for TER, in kHz for SAT)
  Parameter: dvb_t_bandwidth_hz  the channel bandwidth in Hz (only for DVB-T, DVB-T2, ISDB-T)
  Parameter: dvb_t_stream        the HP/LP stream            (only for DVB-T)
  Parameter: symbol_rate_bps     the symbol rate             (for DVB-C, MCNS and SAT)
  Parameter: dvb_c_constellation the DVB-C constellation     (only for DVB-C)
  Parameter: data_slice_id       the DVB-C2 data slice Id    (only for DVB-C2)
  Parameter: plp_id              the PLP Id  (or ISI Id)     (for DVB-T2, for DVB-C2 when num_dslice  > 1 and for DVB-S2 MIS )
  Parameter: T2_lock_mode        the DVB-T2 lock mode        (0='ANY', 1='T2-Base', 2='T2-Lite')
  Return:    1 if locked, 0 otherwise

  Si2183_L2_Tune function

  Porting:    Replace the internal TUNER function calls by the final tuner's corresponding calls
  Comments:   If the tuner is connected via the demodulator's I2C switch, enabling/disabling the i2c_passthru is required before/after tuning.
  Behavior:   This function closes the Si2183's I2C switch then tunes and finally reopens the I2C switch
  Parameter:  *front_end, the front-end handle
  Parameter:  rf, the frequency to tune at

               This situation is possible if there is an I/Q swap in the HW design, for easier routing
               It is perfectly OK to do that to route easily, but the SW needs to be informed of this inversion.
               NB: The additional inversion added by Unicable equipement should not be taken into account here
