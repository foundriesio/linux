	  Utility driver that allows live upload of new CM3 firmware for the
	  R-IN engine processor. This driver *may* not work in case the system
	  is booted in NONSEC mode if the SRAM has been protected away.
	  Any firmware written to this device is copied to SRAM, and the CM3
	  is then reset. No support for 'safe shutdown' of the previous firmware
	  is done by this driver.
	  This driver at this stage is not recommended for production systems,
	  it is mostly useful for developing new CM3 firmwares.
