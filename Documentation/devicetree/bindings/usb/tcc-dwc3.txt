Telechips USB DWC3 controller

Required properties:
 - compatible:          must be "telechips,tcc-dwc3"
 - clocks:              phandle list of usb clocks
 - telechips,dwc3_phy:  must be <&dwc3_phy>
 - #address-cells:      should be <1> if the device has sub-nodes with 'reg'
                        property
   #size-cells:         should be <1> if the device has sub-nodes with 'reg'
                        property
 - ranges:              allows valid 1:1 translation between child's address
                        space and parent's address space

Optional properties:
 - tpl-support:         TPL(Targeted Peripheral List) feature for targeted hosts

Example:

dwc3: dwc3_platform {
	compatible = "telechips,tcc-dwc3";
	clocks = <&clk_fbus FBUS_HSIO>;
	telechips,dwc3_phy = <&dwc3_phy>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;
	tpl-support;

	dwc3 {
		compatible = "snps,dwc3";
		reg = <0x11B00000 0xCFFF>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 152 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		telechips,dwc3_phy = <&dwc3_phy>;
	};
};
