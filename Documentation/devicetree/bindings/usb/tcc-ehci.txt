Required properties:
 - compatible:          must be "telechips,tcc-ehci"
 - reg:                 physical base addresses of the controller and length of
                        memory mapped region
 - interrupts:          interrupt should be described here

Example:

ehci: ehci@11A00000 {
	compatible = "telechips,tcc-ehci";
	reg = <0x11A00000 0x108 0x11DA0010 0x54>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 142 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&clk_hsio HSIOBUS_USB20H &clk_isoip_top ISOIP_TOP_U20H>;
	telechips,ehci_phy = <&ehci_phy>;
	tpl-support;
};
