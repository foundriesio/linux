* Freescale Inter IC (I2C) and High Speed Inter IC (HS-I2C) for i.MX

Required properties:
- compatible :
  - "fsl,imx1-i2c" for I2C compatible with the one integrated on i.MX1 SoC
  - "fsl,imx21-i2c" for I2C compatible with the one integrated on i.MX21 SoC
  - "fsl,vf610-i2c" for I2C compatible with the one integrated on Vybrid vf610 SoC
- reg : Should contain I2C/HS-I2C registers location and length
- interrupts : Should contain I2C/HS-I2C interrupt
- clocks : Should contain the I2C/HS-I2C clock specifier

Optional properties:
- clock-frequency : Constains desired I2C/HS-I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
  The absence of the propoerty indicates the default frequency 100 kHz.
- dmas: A list of two dma specifiers, one for each entry in dma-names.
- dma-names: should contain "tx" and "rx".

Examples:

i2c@83fc4000 { /* I2C2 on i.MX51 */
	compatible = "fsl,imx51-i2c", "fsl,imx21-i2c";
	reg = <0x83fc4000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <63>;
};

i2c@70038000 { /* HS-I2C on i.MX51 */
	compatible = "fsl,imx51-i2c", "fsl,imx21-i2c";
	reg = <0x70038000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <64>;
	clock-frequency = <400000>;
};

i2c0: i2c@40066000 { /* i2c0 on vf610 */
	compatible = "fsl,vf610-i2c";
	reg = <0x40066000 0x1000>;
	interrupts =<0 71 0x04>;
	dmas = <&edma0 0 50>,
		<&edma0 0 51>;
	dma-names = "rx","tx";
};

The driver can provide recovery functionality for cases were the bus gets
stuck with SDA pulled low.
In order to enable this one has to specify an additional pinctrl property with
the name 'recovery' to mux GPIO functionality on SDA/SCL and a gpios
property with the GPIOs for SDA/SCL.
The lack of the gpios property disables the functionality.

Examples:
&i2c3 {
        clock-frequency = <100000>;
        pinctrl-names = "default", "recovery";
        pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_i2c3_1>;
        pinctrl-1 = <&pinctrl_i2c3_recovery_1>;
        gpios = <&gpio3 18 0 /* sda */
                 &gpio3 17 0 /* scl */
                >;
        status = "disabled";
};

When e.g. a device driver detects a stuck bus
int i2c_recover_bus(struct i2c_adapter *adap)
can be called to try to recover the bus.
