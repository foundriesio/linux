Device tree configuration for Telechips I2C Master Controller

Required properties:
- compatible	: Name for matching with the drivevrs depending on chipset
		Should be
		"telechips,tcc805x-i2c"
		"telechips,tcc803x-i2c"
		"telechips,tcc802x-i2c"
		"telechips,tcc901x-i2c"
		"telechips,tcc899x-i2c"
		"telechips,tcc897x-i2c"
		"telechips,i2c"
- reg		: Physical base address and size of the controller's register area.
- interrupts	: Interrupt specifier.
- clocks	: phandle to input clock.
- #address-cells: Should be 1.
- #size-cells	: Should be 0.
- pinctrl-names	: Should be "default"
- pinctrl-0	: phandle to pinctrl function
- port-mux	: I2C port number

Optional properties:
- peri-clock-frequency	: Desired I2C peripheral frequency in Hz, default is 4MHz.
- clock-frequency	: Desired I2C bus frequency in Hz, default is 100kHz.
- interrupt_mode	: interrupt-base transfer, default is not used interrupt.
- noise_filter		: Desired I2C Noise filtering time in ns, default is 50ns
- status		: Activation status

Note:
GPIO used for I2C SCL/SDA are named as number. you can find port number in Chip Specification.
I2C bus frequency is generated from I2C peripheral frequency which is divided by prescale.
If i2c transfer between irqsave function, you should set interrupt_mode to 0.

Examples:

	i2c0: i2c@16300000 {
		reg = <0x16300000 0x1c 0x163c0000 0x10 0x16340004 0x04>;
		compatible = "telechips,tcc803x-i2c";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 61 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clk_peri PERI_I2C0 &clk_io IOBUS_I2C_M0 &clk_fbus FBUS_IO>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupt_mode = <0>;

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&i2c11_bus>;
		port-mux = <11>;
		clock-frequency = <400000>;
		status = "okay";

		dummy@60 {
			compatible = "dummy";
			reg = <0x60>;
		};
	};
