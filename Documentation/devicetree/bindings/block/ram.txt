Telechips RAM block driver

A block driver uses RAM as a storage.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "telechips,ramblk".
- memory-region: specifies the region of the reserved memory.

Example:
	reserved_ramblk: reserved_ramblk {
		compatible = "telechips,pmap";
		telechips,pmap-name = "ramblk";
		no-map;
		size = <0x8000000>;
	};

	ramblk {
		compatible = "telechips,ramblk";
		memory-region = <&reserved_ramblk>;
	};
