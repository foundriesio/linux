Telechips Shared Memory driver

Required properties:

- compatible  : Should be "telechips,tcc_shmem".
- reg         : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers map.
- interrupts  : Describes interrupt source.
- dist-regs   : Specifies address of GIC's distributor of maincore and subcore.
- memory-region : Covers the memory area shared by maincore and subcore.
- core-num    : indicates that '0' is maincore and '1' is 'subcore'.

    tcc_shared_memory: tcc_shared_memory {
        compatible = "telechips,tcc_shmem";
        reg = <0x0 0x38000000 0x0 0x8000000>;
        reg-names = "tcc_shmem";
        interrupts = <GIC_SPI 50 0>;
        leble = "TCC shared memory";
        memory-region = <&pmap_tcc_shmem>;
        dist_regs = <0x17301000 0x1000 0x17C01000 0x1000>;
        core-num = <0>;
    };
