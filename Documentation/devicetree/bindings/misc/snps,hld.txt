Synopsys HDCP Host Library Driver
-----------------------------------------------------
This binding defines the HDCP Host Library Driver that are using synopsys IP.

Required properties:
- compatible : "snps,hld"
- reg : address and length of the register for the HPI interface.
- firmware-size : code size of ESM firmware. The buffer is allocated using
                  dma_free_coherent() on the probe.
- data-size : data size of ESM firmware. The buffer is allocated using
              dma_free_coherent() on the probe.

Example:
	snps-hld {
		compatible = "snps,hld";
		reg = <0x0 0x12440000 0x0 0x80>;
		firmware-size = <0x40000>;
		data-size = <0x20000>;
	};
