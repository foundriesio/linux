Telechips A/D converter Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: depending on the SoC this should be one of:
		"telechips,adc",
		"telechips,tcc803x-adc",
		"telechips,tcc805x-adc",
- reg: the physical base address and length of the registers
- #io-channel-cells: must be 1, see ../iio-bindings.txt

Note: the following property is available on "telechips,adc"
- clocks: phandle and clock identifier
- clock-frequency: Desired ADC peripharl freiquency
- ckin-frequency: Desired ADC Sampling frequency
		  "ckin-frequency" is generated from "clock-frequency" which is divided by prescale.


Optional properties:
- adc-12bit-resolution: boolean, If the property is exist, A/D converts data to 12 bits.
- adc-delay : A/D conversion delay value. It depends on clock-frequency value.
              A/D conversion is delayed by counting clock of "clock-frequency".

Example:

	adc: adc@16050000 {
		compatible = "telechips,adc";
		reg = <0x16050000 0x24 0x1440000C 0x4>;
		clocks = <&clk_peri PERI_TSADC &clk_io IOBUS_TSADC &clk_isoip_top ISOIP_TOP_TSADC>;
		clock-frequency = <12000000>;
		ckin-frequency  = <1000000>;
		adc-12bit-resolution;
		adc-delay = <150>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	or

	adc: adc@1b700000 {
		compatible = "telechips,tcc805x-adc";
		reg = <0x0 0x1b700000 0x0 0xAC>,
		      <0x0 0x1b931088 0x0 0x4>;
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
		status = "okay";
	};
