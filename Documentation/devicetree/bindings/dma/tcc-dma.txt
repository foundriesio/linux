* Telechips GDMA controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "telechips,tcc897x-dma"
              "telechips,tcc899x-dma"
              "telechips,tcc803x-dma"
              "telechips,tcc805x-dma"
              "telechips,tcc901x-dma"
- reg: Specification for the controllers memory mapped register map
- interrupts: Specification for the controllers interrupt
- #dma-cells: Must be 2
- dma-channels: Contains the total number of DMA channels supported by DMAC
- dma-requests: Contains the total number of DMA requests supported by DMAC
- channel-priority: Priority of channels
- clocks: Phandle and specifier to the controllers clock
- clock-names: Clock names

Clients required properties:
- dmas: List of DMA controller phandle, request channel and external request
- dma-names: Names of the aforementioned requested channels

Example:

dma0: dma@16020000 {
	compatible = "telechips,tcc803x-dma";
	reg = <0x16020000 0x94>, /* base address */
	      <0x1605101C 0x04>; /* DMAREQSEL0 */
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 51 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	#dma-cells = <2>;
	dma-channels = <3>;
	dma-requests = <32>;
	channel-priority = <0>;
	clocks = <&clk_io IOBUS_DMA0>;
	clock-names = "dmac0";
};

device@12345678 {
	...
	dmas = <&dma0 0 3 &dma0 1 9>;
	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	...
};
