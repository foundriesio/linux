* Telechips Watchdog Timer for CA7s(CBUS Watchdog) on TCC803x

The watchdog timer used for reset the CA7s processor on TCC803x in the event
of software malfunction. Watchdog on CA7s uses two WDTs, CBUS WDT4, CBUS WDT5.
CBUS WDT4 is used for kick timer, and CBUS WDT5 is used for real watchdog,
which yields watchdog interrupt until it is not kicked.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "telechips,tcc-cb-wdt" 
- reg: Physical base address of the watchdog control register. One is used for
       watchdog kick timer, the other is used for real watchdog.
- clocks: Information about clock ID used by kernel clock driver.
       Refer 'clocks' node on Telechips device tree.
       (arch/arm/boot/dts/tcc/tcc803x.dtsi).
- clock-frequency: Set appropriate clock frequency for watchdog kick timer. 
       By default, kick timer set to 12MHz. By changing this frequency might
       cause variation on kick time interval.
- interrupts: Interrupt # for watchdog kick timer(CBUS WDT4)
- kick-interval: Kick time interval for kick watchdog counter.
- expire-timeout: Expiration time for real watchdog(CBUS WDT5).

Example:
        tcc_cb_wdt: tcc_cb_wdt@3 {
                compatible = "telechips,tcc-cb-wdt";
                reg = <0x17040000 0x10000>,	/* watchdog kick timer */
                    <0x17050000 0x10000>;	/* real watchdog */
                clocks= <&clk_peri PERI_CB_WDT>;
                clock-frequency = <12000000>;
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 121 0>;

                kick-interval = <5>;
                expire-timeout = <20>;

                status = "okay";
        };
