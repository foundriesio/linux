 * ARM DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) CPU memory power managemnt DevFreq device

The cache in the ARM DynamIQ Shared Unit (DSU) supports partial power down by
splitting the cache into an implementation-specific number of portions.
The DSU portion control DevFreq driver provides an energy-cost justified
demand-driven policy for controlling the number of portions enabled.

The driver also provides a specific DevFreq governor that will implement the
desired energy-cost-justification policy. This policy maps the number of
portions enabled to frequency (1 portion == 1Hz).

The driver does not control the clock frequency of the cache.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "arm,dsu_pctrl_r0"

Optional properties:
 - size: size of the cache in KB
 - line-size: size of the cache line in bytes
 - static-leakage-per-mb: static power leakage for each MB of cache in uW/MB
 - dram-energy-per-mb: energy consumed for each MB of DRAM accessed in uJ/MB
 - polling: polling time in miliseconds

Example:
	dsu_pctrl: dsu_pctrl {
		compatible = "arm,dsu_pctrl_r0";
		size = <1024>; /* size in KB */
		line-size = <64>;
		static-leakage-per-mb = <10000>; /*uW/MB */
		dram-energy-per-mb = <130>; /* uJ/MB */
		polling = <10000>; /* miliseconds */
	};
