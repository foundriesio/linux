* MTD QSPI driver for RZN1

This driver should contains subnodes that corresponds to the m25p80.txt format,
with a few optional options.

Required properties:
- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
      representing flash devices on different CS lines.
- compatible : Should be "renesas,rzn1-qspi".
- reg-names : "qspi", "qspi-mapping" -- necessary to locate which address range
      is the register one, and which one is the memory map for the flash.
- clock-names : must be "flexway", "pclk"

Optional properties:
- renesas,rzn1-cs_mux[ = <0/1>];
	This specifies wether we want to use the discrete CS lines (default
	mode) to handle up to 4 NOR chips, or if we want to use the 'mux'
	mode that can handle up to 16 of them.
	Note that this property is optional (default to zero), and it will also
	default to '1' in the case any of the sub flashes specified below have
	a CS number >3
Furthermore, each sub node for each chip may contain (on top of the m25p80):
- spi-max-frequency: Same definition as spi-bus
- spi-rx-bus-width : Same definition as spi-bus
- spi-cpha : Same definition as spi-bus
- spi-cpol : Same definition as spi-bus

- renesas,rzn1-read-cmd [ = <COMMAND DUMMY ADDR_MUX>];
	Syntax is:
	    + COMMAND: Read Array opcode to use
	    + DUMMY: Number of dummy/mode cycles
	    + ADDR_MUX: 0/1: If the address sent to the NOR flash is sent on
			     multiple pins.
	The number of address bytes is optional, if not set here (or zero)
	the driver will rely on what the spi-nor framework decides to set it
	to. It's likely it will attempt to set the device forcibly in 4 bytes
	mode, which can be an issue at reset time (for the ROM and such) if
	the SPI NOR doesn't have a dedicated coupled reset line.
	IMPORTANT NOTE: Use of this property requires the SPI NOR flash to be
		marked as SPI_NOR_DUAL_READ and/or SPI_NOR_QUAD_READ in the
		spi-nor driver in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/spi-nor.c -- without this
		flag, the driver will fail to work.
- renesas,rzn1-readcap-delay = <N>;
	Specifies the read delay to use when talking to the flash at high speed
	The value can be probed using u-boot and should be constant for each
	type of flash, however board layout might have some impact.

Example:

spi@RZN1_QSPI_BASE {
	compatible = "renesas,rzn1-qspi";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <RZN1_QSPI_BASE RZN1_QSPI_SIZE
		RZN1_V_QSPI_BASE RZN1_V_QSPI_SIZE>;
	reg-names = "qspi", "qspi-mapping";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI
		RZN1_IRQ_QSPI0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&clk_fw_qspi0>, <&clk_qspi0>;
	clock-names = "flexway", "pclk";
	status = "okay";

	renesas,rzn1-cs_mux = <0>;

	flash: mx25l12805@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "st,mx25l12805d";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <62500000>;
		spi-cpha;
		spi-cpol;

		/* Use 0x6b command to read data on 4 lines,
		   using 8 dummy cycles, and
		   the address is also sent on 4 lines.
		   Check your datasheet for the 'optimal' opcode to use;
		   the spi-nor upper layer defaults to slightly less
		   optimal opcodes */
		spi-rx-bus-width = <4>;
		renesas,rzn1-read-cmd = <0x6b 8 1>;

		renesas,rzn1-readcap-delay = <1>;

		partition@0 {
			/* 1MB */
			label = "loader";
			reg = <0x000000 0x00100000>;
		};
		partition@1 {
			/* 1MB */
			label = "u-boot";
			reg = <0x100000 0x00100000>;
		};
	};
