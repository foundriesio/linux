Telechips reboot mode driver

The driver gets reboot mode magic value from reboot-mode driver and store it.
Then the bootloader can read it and take different action according to the magic
value stored.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "telechips,reboot-mode"

The rest of the properties should follow the generic reboot-mode description
found in reboot-mode.txt

Example:
	reboot-mode {
		compatible = "telechips,reboot-mode";
		mode-normal = <BOOT_NORMAL>;
		mode-bootloader = <BOOT_FASTBOOT>;
		mode-recovery = <BOOT_RECOVERY>;
	};
