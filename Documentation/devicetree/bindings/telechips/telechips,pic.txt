* Telechips PIC(Programmable Interrupt Controller)

Telechips SoC use ARM GIC(Generic Interrupt Controller) basically
as an interrupt controller. But, ARM GIC support only rising edge triggered
or active high level interrupt. For this reason, the role of the PIC
is minimized to set a polarity of interrupts.

Required properties:
- compatible: Dependent on Telechips SoC
	"telechips,tcc805x-pic"
	"telechips,tcc805x-pic"
	"telechips,tcc803x-pic"
	"telechips,tccsub-ca7-pic"
	"telechips,tcc901x-pic"
	"telechips,tcc899x-pic"
	"telechips,tcc897x-pic"
- reg: Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- demarcation: The demarcation of the register set.
	PIC registers have not designed sequentially and divided into two sections.
- max_irq: Total interrupts that Telechips SoC has

Example:
tcc_pic: pic@14100000 {
	compatible = "telechips,tcc805x-pic";
	reg = <0x0 0x141000E0 0x0 0x0018>,  /* pol_0_base */
	      <0x0 0x14600100 0x0 0x0024>,  /* pol_1_base */
	      <0x0 0x14800040 0x0 0x003C>,  /* cmb_cm4_base */
	      <0x0 0x14900040 0x0 0x003C>,  /* strgb_cm4_base */
	      <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0>;            /* ca7_irqo_en_base */
	demarcation = <192>;
	max_irq = <480>;
};
