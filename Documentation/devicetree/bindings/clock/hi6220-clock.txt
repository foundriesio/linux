* Hisilicon Hi6220 Clock Controller

The hi6220 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the hi6220 SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
  - "hisilicon,hi6220-clock-ao" - controller for those clocks under
     SoC power always on domain.
  - "hisilicon,hi6220-clock-sys" - controller for those clocks under
     SoC system control domain.
  - "hisilicon,hi6220-clock-media" - controller for those clocks under
     SoC media control domain.
  - "hisilicon,hi6220-clock-power" - controller for those clocks under
     SoC power control domain.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume.

All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/hi6220-clock.h>.
