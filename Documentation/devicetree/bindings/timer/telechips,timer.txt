* Telechips Timer Counter

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "telechips,timer".
- reg: Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts: A list of 6 interrupt; one per timer channel.
- clocks: Should contain a reference to timer counter clock.
- clock-frequency: The rate of the clock that drives the timer counter, in Hz.

Optional properties:
- tcc-timer-reserved: Reserve a timer for the LPO clocksource.
- tcc-timer-reserved-for-wdt: Reserve a timer to kick watchdog.

Example:

tcc_timer: timer@14300000 { /* tc0~tc5 */
	compatible = "telechips,timer";
	reg = <0x0 0x14300000 0x0 0xa0>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 33 0>,
		     <GIC_SPI 34 0>,
		     <GIC_SPI 35 0>,
		     <GIC_SPI 36 0>,
		     <GIC_SPI 37 0>,
		     <GIC_SPI 38 0>;
	clocks = <&clk_peri PERI_TCT>;
	clock-frequency = <12000000>;

	/* timer 0 and 1 are reserved for watchdog (default) */
	tcc-timer-reserved-for-wdt = <0 1>;
};
