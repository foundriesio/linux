* Device tree bindings for Renesas RZ/N1 timer

This document provides bindings for the timer block in the RZ/N1 devices. The
timer block has 8 independent timers, each of which can be driven by an input
clock that can optionally be divided down by 25. Each timer generates it's own
interrupt.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "renesas,rzn1-timer" and one of the following.
 - "renesas,r9a06g032-timer": for RZ/N1D
 - "renesas,r9a06g033-timer": for RZ/N1S
- reg: base address and length of the registers for the timer block.
- interrupts : All 8 interrupts generated by the timer block.
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair.

Optional Properties:
- renesas,clk-prescaler: A list of boolean flags to enable the divide-by-25
  prescaler for each of the timers. Without this property, prescale is not used.
- renesas,timer-rating: A list of clock rating values for all timers. This can
  be used to ensure this timer has a higher or lower rating than other timers.

Example:

timer0: timer@51001000 {
	compatible = "renesas,r9a06g032-timer", "renesas,rzn1-timer";
	reg = <0x51001000 0x400>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 112 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 113 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 114 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 115 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 116 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 117 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 118 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 119 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&hclk_timer0>;
	renesas,clk-prescaler = <1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0>;
	renesas,timer-rating = <150 150 150 150 150 150 460 460>;
};
