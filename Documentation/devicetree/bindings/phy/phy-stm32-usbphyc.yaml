title: STMicroelectronics STM32 USB HS PHY controller binding

description:

  The STM32 USBPHYC block contains a dual port High Speed UTMI+ PHY and a UTMI
  switch. It controls PHY configuration and status, and the UTMI+ switch that
  selects either OTG or HOST controller for the second PHY port. It also sets
  PLL configuration.

          It can be necessary to adjust the PHY settings to compensate parasitics, which can be due
          to USB connector/receptacle, routing, ESD protection component,... Here is the list of
          all optional parameters to tune the interface of the PHY (HS for High-Speed, FS for Full-
          Speed, LS for Low-Speed)

                                <2> current boosting of 2mA
            * st,no-lsfs-fb-cap, disables the LS/FS feedback capacitor
            * st,hs-slew-ctrl, slows the HS driver slew rate by 10%
            * st,hs-dc-level, <0> decreases the HS driver DC level by 5 to 7mV
                              <1> increases the HS driver DC level by 5 to 7mV
                              <2> increases the HS driver DC level by 10 to 14mV
            * st,fs-rftime-tuning, enables the FS rise/fall tuning option
            * st,hs-rftime-reduction, enables the HS rise/fall reduction feature
            * st,hs-current-trim, controls HS driver current trimming for choke
            * st,hs-impedance-trim, controls HS driver impedance tuning for choke
            * st,squelch-level, adjusts the squelch DC threshold value
            * st,hs-rx-gain-eq, enables the HS Rx gain equalizer
            * st,hs-rx-offset, adjusts the HS Rx offset
            * st,no-hs-ftime-ctrl, disables the HS fall time control of single ended signals
                                   during pre-emphasis
            * st,no-lsfs-sc, disables the short circuit protection in LS/FS driver
            * st,hs-tx-staggering, enables the basic staggering in HS Tx mode
