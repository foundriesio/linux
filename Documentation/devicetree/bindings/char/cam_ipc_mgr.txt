* Device Tree Bindings for Camera IPC Manager

  Camera IPC Manager (a.k.a. cam_ipc) is a device driver to communicate between
  mcu and sub-core, which is needed for trust RVC since TCC805X.

  Trust RVC checks the state of sub-core by transferring a request message to
  sub-core via mailbox. Then, sub-core sends back an ACK to MCU. If the message
  cannot receive by MCU, Trust RVC will recognize the state of subcore as safety
  state, it will control the video mux and change the display bus from DDIBUS to
  Trust RVC.

Required properties:

- status     : disable or enable the device node
- compatible : property name that conveys the platform architecture identifiers,
               as 'telechips,cam_ipc_mgr'
- mbox-names : the name of mailbox
- mboxes     : specifies the channel for the mailbox (IPC)
- mbox-id    : specifies the mailbox id for camera ipc manager
- device-name: the name of the device

Example
-------
	cam_ipc_mgr0: cam_ipc_mgr@0 {
		compatible = "telechips,cam_ipc_mgr";
		device-name ="cam_ipc_mgr_sub";
		mbox-names ="sub-cam-ipc";
		mboxes = <&micom_mbox TCC_MICOM_MBOX1_CAMIPC>;
		mbox-id = TCC_MBOX_CAMIPC_ID;
		status = "okay";
	};
