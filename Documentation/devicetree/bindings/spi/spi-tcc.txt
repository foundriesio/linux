Telechips GPSB Controller for SPI Master/Slave

Genral Purpose Serial Bus (GPSB) Controller supports SPI Master / Slave mode
There are 6 GPSB controllers.
3 GPSB controllers (Controller-0/1/2) have 2 buffers (TX FIFO, RX FIFO) with dedicated DMA.
3 GPSB controllers (Controller-3/4/5) have 2 buffers (TX FIFO, RX FIFO) without dedicated DMA.
the following is FIFO size depending on bit width.
- 32-bit x 8-depth
- 16-bit x 16-depth
-  8-bit x 16-dpeth


Required properties:
- compatible	: depending on the SoC this should be one of:
		"telechips,tcc-spi-slave"
		"telechips,tcc-spi"
		"telechips,tcc805x-spi"
		"telechips,tcc803x-spi"
		"telechips,tcc897x-spi"
		"telechips,tcc899x-spi"
		"telechips,tcc901x-spi"
- reg		: Base address and size of the controllers memory area
- interrupts	: Interrupt Specifier
- clocks	: phandle of the GPSB clock
- #address-cells: <1>, as required by generic SPI binding
- #size-cells	: <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding
- pinctrl-names	: Should be "idle","active"
- pinctrl-0	: phandle to pinctrl function in idle state
- pinctrl-1	: phandle to pinctrl function in active state
- gpsb-id	: SPI ID
- gpsb-port	: gpsb port number
Note:
GPIO used for GPSB are named as number. you can find port number in Chip Specification.
the following property is available on gpsb 3 ~ 5, because there are no dedicated-dma.
- dmas		: Must contain a list of two references to DMA specifiers,
		  one for transmission, and one for reception.
- dma-names	: Must contain a list of two DMA names, "tx" and "rx".


Optional properties:
- access-control0/1/2/3	: address filtering
			DMA can access only a region of address.
			If the region of DMA address is out of the range that you set in device tree,
			GPSB Send 0 and cannot read the data.
- spi-slave		: Empty property indicating the SPI controller is used in slave mode.
- prd-enable		: Capture at every even-numbered order edge of SCK.
- sdoe-enable		: SDO is driven only when CS signal tells active.
- write-threshold	: Transmit FIFO threshold for interrupt/DMA request.
- read-threshold	: Receive FIFO threshold for interrupt/DMA request.

Optional properties (master mode only):
- recovery-time		: Increase recovery-time.
- hold-time		: Increase hold-time.
- setup-time		: Increase setup-time.
Note: Please refer the Full/Chip Specification for more detail.
- ctf-mode-disable	: boolean, If the property is exist, GPSB transfer in single mode.
			for more detail in "TCCxxxx Common BSP-User Guide for Driver" Document.
- cs-gpios		: gpios chip select.
- num-cs		: total number of chipselects.

If cs-gpios is used the number of chip selects will be increased automatically
with max(cs-gpios > hw cs).
So if for example the controller has 2 CS lines, and the cs-gpios
property looks like this:
cs-gpios = <&gpg 8 0>,<&gpa 30 0>;

Optional subnodes:
	Subnodes are use to represent the SPI slave devices connected to the SPI
	master. They follow the generic SPI bindings as outlined in spi-bus.txt.


Example:
	/* GPSB Controller 0 - SPI Master */
	gpsb0: gpsb0@16900000 {
		compatible = "telechips,tcc803x-spi";
		reg = <0x16900000 0x38>,   /* base address */
			<0x16960000 0x20>, /* Port Configuration register */
			<0x16980000 0x20>; /* GPSB_0_AC */
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clk_peri PERI_GPSB0 &clk_io IOBUS_GPSB0>;
		gpsb-id = <0>;

		//access-control0 = <0x20000000 0xC0000000>; /* DRAM */

		status = "okay";
		gpsb-port = <22>;
		pinctrl-names = "idle", "active";
		pinctrl-0 = <&gpsb22_bus_idle>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&gpsb22_bus_spi>;

		/* cs-gpios */
		cs-gpios = <&gpg 8 0>,<&gpa 30 0>;

		spidev@0 {
			compatible = "rohm,dh2228fv";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <2000000>;
		};
		spidev@1 {
			compatible = "rohm,dh2228fv";
			reg = <1>;
			spi-max-frequency = <2000000>;
		};
	};

	or

	/* GPSB Controller 3 - SPI Slave */
	gpsb3: gpsb3@16930000 {
		compatible = "telechips,spi-slave";
		reg = <0x16930000 0x38 0x16960000 0x20>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 58 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clk_peri PERI_GPSBMS0 &clk_io IOBUS_GPSB3>
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		/* With DMA-engine */
		dmas = <&dma0 0 3 &dma0 1 9>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";

		gpsb-id = <3>;
		pinctrl-names = "idle", "active";
		pinctrl-0 = <&gpsb19_bus_idle>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&gpsb19_bus_spi>;
		gpsb-port = <19>;
		spi-slave;
		slave@0 {
			compatible = "rohm,dh2228fv";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <20000000>;
		};
	};
