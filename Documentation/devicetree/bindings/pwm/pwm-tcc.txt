Telechips PWM drivers

Required properties:
- compatible		: "telechips,pwm"
- reg				: Physical base address and size of the controller's register area.
- tcc,pwm-number	: Should be 4. Total number of ports supported by the chip.
					  Refer to Full Specification for ports infomation.
- #pwm-cells		: Should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.
- clocks			: phandle to input clock.
- clock-frequency	: Desired PWM frequency in Hz.

- pinctrl-names		: Sould be "default".
- pinctrl-0			: phandle to pinctrl function.
- gfb-port			: Port mapping number for PDM0, PDM1, PDM2, PDM3
- status			: Activation status

Note: You can control PWM unit in a simple way by automatically generating a
LUT using a Linux Kernel generic LDE driver. Refer to the "Application Not for
PWM" documentation.

Example:

pwm:pwm@16030000 { /* pwm */
		compatible = "telechips,pwm";
		reg = <0x16030000 0x90 0x1605104C 0x4 0x16051094 0x4>;
		tcc,pwm-number = <4>;
		#pwm-cells = <2>;
		clocks = <&clk_peri PERI_PDM &clk_io IOBUS_PWM>;
		clock-frequency = <400000000>;

		pinctrl-names ="default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&led_pin_a>;
		gfb-port = <52 0 0 0>;     //port mapping number for PDM0, PDM1, PDM2, PDM3
		status = "okay";
};
