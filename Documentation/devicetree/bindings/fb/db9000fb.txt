* Digital Blocks DB9000 LCD Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "digitalblocks,db9000-clcd".
- reg: Address and length of the register set for lcdif
- interrupts: Should contain lcdif interrupts
- display : phandle to display node (see below for details)
- clocks: Clock phandles to the pixel and bus (ahb) clocks.

Optional properties:
- backlight-pwm-clock : If using the DB9000 PWM output for a backlight, this
  specifies the PWM output clock required.
- blink-period-ms : If built with CONFIG_FB_DB9000_BLINK, this specifies the
  blink period in ms, see the config menu.
- bus-width : The width of the interface to the LCD panel that is actually
  used. This is only needed if the bits-per-pixel property is set to 16 or
  less, but the board connects to a 24-bit panel. In which case, the controller
  will shift the 16-bit data to the most significant bits of the panel. If the
  buffer is less than 16bpp, the controller will use a palette to effectively
  generate 16bpp data for the panel.

* display node

Required properties:
- bits-per-pixel : <1>, <2>, <4>, <8> for paletted RGB565, <16> for RGB565,
  <24> for packed RGB888, <32> for RGB888.

Required sub-node:
- display-timings : Refer to binding doc display-timing.txt for details.

Examples:

fb0: fb@RZN1_LCD_BASE {
	compatible = "digitalblocks,db9000-clcd";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI RZN1_IRQ_LCD IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	reg = <RZN1_LCD_BASE RZN1_LCD_SIZE>;
	clock-names = "pclk", "ahb";
	clocks = <&clk_slcd>, <&clk_ahb_lcd>;
	status = "okay";

	bits-per-pixel = <32>;
	display-timings {
		native-mode = <&timing0>;
		timing0: timing0 {
			clock-frequency = <8000000>;
			hactive = <320>;
			vactive = <240>;
			hback-porch = <68>;
			hfront-porch = <20>;
			vback-porch = <18>;
			vfront-porch = <4>;
			hsync-len = <2>;
			vsync-len = <2>;
			hsync-active = <0>;
			vsync-active = <0>;
			de-active = <1>;
		};
	};
};
