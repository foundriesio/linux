Bindings for Telechips SC MMC driver

In TCC805x, CPU accesses eMMC by requesting the commands to SC(Storage Core)
which is the co-processor to manage eMMC access.
This driver requests the operation of each command through SC firmware
protocol driver.

Note: Do not bind SDHCI driver for SDMMC channel which is used by SC.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "telechips,tcc805x-sc-mmc".
- sc-firmware: The phandle of SC firmware protocol driver.

These properties do not affect the operation because SC F/W controls operation.
But they are needed to defines explicilty for kernel MMC driver operation.

- max-frequency: maximum operating clock frequency.
- bus-width: Number of data lines.
- vqmmc-supply: The phandle of regulator which should be "regulator-fixed".
- no-sdio: controller is limited to send sdio cmd during initialization.
- no-sd: controller is limited to send sd cmd during initialization.
- non-removable: non-removable slot (like eMMC); assume always present.
- disable-wp: When set no physical WP line is present.
- mmc-hs400-1_8v: eMMC HS400 mode(1.8V I/O) is supported.
