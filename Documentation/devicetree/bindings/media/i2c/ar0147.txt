- compatible : property name that conveys the platform architecture identifiers,
               as 'onnn,ar0147'
- reg        : I2C slave address
- port       : specifies the endpoint of the sensor (output only)

example
-------
	ar0147: ar0147 {
		status		= "disabled";
		compatible	= "onnn,ar0147";
		reg		= <0x10>;
		port {
			ar0147_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&max96701_in>;
				io-direction	= "output";
			};
		};
	};
