 * Hisilicon hi6220 SoC's Display Subsystem for HiKey board

 ** display-subsystem: Master device for binding DRM sub-components
    This master device is parent node and it will be responsible to bind all
    sub-components devices node.
    - Required properties :
      - compatible: "hisilicon,display-subsystem".
      - #address-cells, #size-cells: Must be present if the device has sub-nodes.
      - ranges: to allow probing of subdevices.
      - dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent.

 ** ade: Graphic overlay, Graphic post-processing, display timing control.
    This device is child node of display-subsystem
    - Required properties :
      - compatible: "hisilicon,hi6220-ade".
      - reg: physical base address of the ADE register and length of memory
	region.
      - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "ade_base" and "media_base".
      - interrupt: The interrupt number to the cpu. Defines the interrupt
        by ADE.
      - clocks: The clocks needed by the ADE module.
      - clock-names: the name of the clocks.

 ** dsi: support mipi dsi interface
    This device is child node of display-subsystem
    - Required properties :
      - compatible: "hisilicon,hi6220-dsi".
      - reg: physical base address of the DSI register and length of memory
	region.
      - clocks: The clocks needed by the DSI module.
      - clock-names: the name of the clocks.
      -	encoder-slave: phandles to a 'encoder-slave' subnode which DSI connect
        ADV7533 in order to support hdmi display.

Example:

	display-subsystem {
		compatible = "hisilicon,drm-hi6220";
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;
		dma-coherent;

		ade: ade@f4100000 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hi6220-ade";
			reg = <0x0 0xf4100000 0x0 0x7800>,
			      <0x0 0xf4410000 0x0 0x1000>;
			reg-names = "ade_base",
				    "media_base";
			interrupts = <0 115 4>;

			clocks = <&media_ctrl HI6220_ADE_CORE>,
				 <&media_ctrl HI6220_CODEC_JPEG>,
				 <&media_ctrl HI6220_ADE_PIX_SRC>;
			/*clock name*/
			clock-names  = "clk_ade_core",
				       "aclk_codec_jpeg_src",
				       "clk_ade_pix";
		};

		dsi {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hi6220-dsi";
			reg = <0x0 0xf4107800 0x0 0x100>;
			clocks = <&media_ctrl  HI6220_DSI_PCLK>;
			clock-names = "pclk_dsi";
			encoder-slave = <&adv7533>;
		};
	};
