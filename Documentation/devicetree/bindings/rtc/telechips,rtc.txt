* Telechips RTC(Real Time Clock)

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "telechips,rtc".
- reg: Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts: A single interrupt specifier.
- clocks: Must contain one or more entry, for the RTC IP block.


Optional properties:
These properties are available at tcc805x.
- rtc_clock: Clocksource for the RTC
- rtc_timeout: RTC timeout in seconds for Suspend-To-RAM Telechips solution.
	The system will be transit to the power-down mode when it is expired
	after entering suspend mode.

Example:

rtc: rtc@0x16480000 {
	compatible = "telechips,rtc";
	reg = <0x0 0x16480000 0x0 0x50>;
	clocks = <&clk_io IOBUS_RTC>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 73 0>;
	/* Clocksource for RTC, 1: XTAL, 2: OSC */
	rtc_clock = <1>;
	/* RTC timeout in seconds for Suspend-To-RAM */
	rtc_timeout = <172800>;
};
